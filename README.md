# dotfiles
This repo contains some dotfiles to ease the process of having a known
environment wherever I go.

Most of the stuff is "stolen"/inspired from others. What made me choose this
setup was looking at [https://github.com/mitsuhiko](Mitsuhiko's) dotfiles
repo.

My Vim plugins is handled with Vundle. Read more about it
